# WaterApp

WaterApp is a mobile application built using React Native. The goal of the app is simple=-- to allow users to track how much water they intake a day through a counter.
The app allows for user sign-up/login and offers small rewards in the form of Pokemon evolutions as users get close to the recommended 8 cups of water a day.
